   <h1>Tracing Statement Sequences</h1>

   <h2>Statements</h2>

<p>
   It is common across a variety of programming languages and programming
styles to structure code as a sequence of what one might consider to be
commands or actions to perform. In the context of the study of programming
languages, and in Python, such commands are included in a category of
language constructs called <em>statements</em>. A given programming language
may define many different statements (Python defines more than 20, but
only a core set is covered in this text) to associate values with names,
to take different actions based on values, to repeat actions based on
values, and more. These values used within such statements are, of course,
determined by evaluating expressions. In one view of programming, a programmer
combines statements (and the expressions within) to build a program as a
series of actions.
</p>

   <h2>Assignment Statement</h2>
<p>
Consider evaluating the  expression <code>a*a + b*b</code>. Given Python's
operator precedence rules and our explicit steps of evaluation,
the evaluation of this expression requires evaluating the left operand
(<code>a*a</code>) of the addition before evaluating the right operand.
This, in turn, requires evaluating the left operand of that nested
multiplication, which is the identifier <code>a</code>. In each of the
earlier expression evaluation examples the value of an identifier was
given as part of the problem statement (e.g., <quote>"evaluate the
following expression with the assumption that <code>a</code> has the
value 3"</quote>). As we transition to tracing the execution of programs
no such assumptions will be stated
<sup><a id="footnote-1-home" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>.
Instead, the code itself will need to determine and associate a value with
each identifier.
</p>

<p>
An assignment statement can be used to <em>bind</em> a value to an identifier
(sometimes phrased as naming a value, giving a value a name, or assigning
a value to a variable). This is written as in the example that follows,
where an identifer (name) is
specified to the left of an <code>=</code> symbol
<sup><a id="footnote-2-home" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> and an
expression to determine the value is given to the right of the
<code>=</code> symbol. In this specific example, the expression is
evaluated to the value <code>5</code> and that value is bound to the
identifier <code>a</code>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>a = 3 + 2</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Assignment statements are used to great effect to improve code readability
by giving meaningful names to computed value, to avoid repeated evaluation
of the same expression when its resulting value is to be used more than
once, and to break larges expressions into smaller pieces. Such uses commonly
lead to a sequence of statements as in the following example (with each
statement now numbered for reference).
</p>

<blockquote class="code">
<ul>
<li><span class="code_gutter">1</span><span class="code_line">x1 = 2</span></li>
<li><span class="code_gutter">2</span><span class="code_line">y1 = 4</span></li>
<li><span class="code_gutter">3</span><span class="code_line">x2 = 10</span></li>
<li><span class="code_gutter">4</span><span class="code_line">y2 = 7</span></li>
<li><span class="code_gutter">5</span><span class="code_line">delta_x = x2 - x1</span></li>
<li><span class="code_gutter">6</span><span class="code_line">delta_y = y2 - y1</span></li>
<li><span class="code_gutter">7</span><span class="code_line">distance_squared = delta_x*delta_x + delta_y*delta_y</span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
   Evaluating this code will require evaluating multiple expressions (such
as <code>x2 - x1</code>) that include the use of identifiers. Furthermore,
the later lines of code rely on the evaluation of the earlier lines of code
to determine the values associated with the identifers used. More specifically,
the evaluation of the expression in the assignment statement on line 7
(i.e., the expression <code>delta_x*delta_x + delta_y*delta_y</code>)
requires that the values associated with identifiers <code>delta_x</code> and
<code>delta_y</code> be
known; these identifiers are assigned values on lines 5 and 6.
</p>

   <h3>Sequencing</h3>
<p>
   Evaluation of a sequence of statements begins at the first and continues
through the last. In the example above, the assignment statement on line
1 will evaluate before that on line 2, which evaluates before line 3, and
so on. This "flow of control" from the first statement (top) to the last
statement (bottom) is important to the proper evaluation of a sequence of
statements (i.e., evaluation proceeds from top to bottom or from first to
last). This "flow" is illustrated in the trace tables below.
</p>

<p>
Later sections will introduce statements that augment this standard flow
of control, but they are best viewed as modifications of the standard
flow of control.
</p>


   <h2>Trace Tables</h2>
<p>
   Evaluating a sequence of assignment statements is done by evaluating
each assignment statement in turn, from top to bottom. The evaluation of an
assignment statement requires evaluating the expression within to determine
the value
to bind to the specified identifier (to the left of the <code>=</code>
symbol).  Of course, evaluating such an expression will often require using
the known <em>identifier bindings</em> (identifier/variable names and their
associated values) to determine the values of the identifiers used within
the expression.  This can be a lot to track, so our analysis will benefit
from some structure. This section introduces trace tables to structure our
reasoning of the evaluation of statement sequences. At present such
sequences will include only assignment statements, but later chapters will
extend the use of these trace tables to more advanced programs.
</p>


<h3>Beginning</h3>

<p>
We begin tracing with a table that includes one row per line in the program under evaluation. These
rows, from top to bottom, represent the flow of control through the evaluation of the statement
sequence. Each row will be updated to include any bindings established by the statement on the
corresponding line. Prior to evaluating the first line of code, the set of Known Bindings is
empty<sup><a id="footnote-3-home" href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup>.
</p>

<div class="trace">
<blockquote class="code">
<ul>
<li><span class="code_gutter">1</span><span class="code_line">x1 = 2</span></li>
<li><span class="code_gutter">2</span><span class="code_line">y1 = 4</span></li>
<li><span class="code_gutter">3</span><span class="code_line">x2 = 10</span></li>
<li><span class="code_gutter">4</span><span class="code_line">y2 = 7</span></li>
<li><span class="code_gutter">5</span><span class="code_line">delta_x = x2 - x1</span></li>

<h3>Step One</h3>

<p>
Evaluation of the statement on Line 1 binds the value <code>2</code> to <code>x1</code> which
is reflected in the trace table as an entry for Line 1. As written, this appears as a simple
duplicate of the line of code in the program, but this is only because that line is an assignment
of an integer literal (<code>2</code>) to an identifier. More generally, each binding is an
association between an identifier and a value.

<p>
   You should complete the table for the evaluation of Lines 2 through 4 before moving on.
</p>

<h3>Steps Two Through Four</h3>

<p>
Lines 2 through 4 are similarly structured assignment statements (wherein the expression is a
literal value), so the introduction of new bindings proceeds in the same manner as for Line 1. The
table below shows those entries.
</p>

<h3>Steps Five and Six</h3>

<p>
On Line 5, to evaluate the expression <code>x2 - x1</code> we must know the value bound to
<code>x2</code> and the value bound to <code>x1</code>. The Trace Table can be used to determine
these values based on the previously evaluated statements. To find these values, we look to the
trace table for the row that corresponds to the line being evaluated (Line 5, here). We then
search the table in reverse (from this row to the first row), stopping if a binding for the
identifier we seek is found. It is this value that must be used in the expression evaluation.

<p>
For the evaluation of Line 5, when searching for the value of <code>x2</code>, the rows corresponding
to Line 4 and Line 3 are examined. The binding <code>x2 = 10</code> is found, giving 10 as the value
to use for <code>x2</code>. Similarly, when searching for the value of <code>x1</code>, the rows for
Lines 4, 3, 2, and 1 (in this order) are examined. The binding <code>x1 = 2</code> is found, giving 2
as the value to use for the evaluation of <code>x1</code>. With these values determined, the assignment
on Line 5 can be evaluated and the new binding added to the table.
