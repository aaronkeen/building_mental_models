   <h1>Tracing Statement Sequences</h1>

   <h2>Statements</h2>

<p>
   It is common across a variety of programming languages and programming
styles to structure code as a sequence of what one might consider to be
commands or actions to perform. In the context of the study of programming
languages, and in Python, such commands are included in a category of
language constructs called <em>statements</em>. A given programming language
may define many different statements (Python defines more than 20, but
only a core set is covered in this text) to associate values with names,
to take different actions based on values, to repeat actions based on
values, and more. These values used within such statements are, of course,
determined by evaluating expressions. In one view of programming, a programmer
combines statements (and the expressions within) to build a program as a
series of actions.
</p>

   <h2>Assignment Statement</h2>
<p>
Consider evaluating the  expression <code>a*a + b*b</code>. Given Python's
operator precedence rules and our explicit steps of evaluation,
the evaluation of this expression requires evaluating the left operand
(<code>a*a</code>) of the addition before evaluating the right operand.
This, in turn, requires evaluating the left operand of that nested
multiplication, which is the identifier <code>a</code>. In each of the
earlier expression evaluation examples the value of an identifier was
given as part of the problem statement (e.g., <quote>"evaluate the
following expression with the assumption that <code>a</code> has the
value 3"</quote>). As we transition to tracing the execution of programs
no such assumptions will be stated
<sup><a id="footnote-1-home" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>.
Instead, the code itself will need to determine and associate a value with
each identifier.
</p>

<p>
An assignment statement can be used to <em>bind</em> a value to an identifier
(sometimes phrased as naming a value, giving a value a name, or assigning
a value to a variable). This is written as in the example that follows,
where an identifer (name) is
specified to the left of an <code>=</code> symbol
<sup><a id="footnote-2-home" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> and an
expression to determine the value is given to the right of the
<code>=</code> symbol. In this specific example, the expression is
evaluated to the value <code>5</code> and that value is bound to the
identifier <code>a</code>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>a = 3 + 2</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Assignment statements are used to great effect to improve code readability
by giving meaningful names to computed value, to avoid repeated evaluation
of the same expression when its resulting value is to be used more than
once, and to break larges expressions into smaller pieces. Such uses commonly
lead to a sequence of statements as in the following example (with each
statement now numbered for reference).
</p>

<blockquote class="code">
<ul>
<li><span class="code_gutter">1</span><span class="code_line">x1 = 2</span></li>
<li><span class="code_gutter">2</span><span class="code_line">y1 = 4</span></li>
<li><span class="code_gutter">3</span><span class="code_line">x2 = 10</span></li>
<li><span class="code_gutter">4</span><span class="code_line">y2 = 7</span></li>
<li><span class="code_gutter">5</span><span class="code_line">delta_x = x2 - x1</span></li>
<li><span class="code_gutter">6</span><span class="code_line">delta_y = y2 - y1</span></li>
<li><span class="code_gutter">7</span><span class="code_line">distance_squared = delta_x*delta_x + delta_y*delta_y</span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
   Evaluating this code will require evaluating multiple expressions (such
as <code>x2 - x1</code>) that include the use of identifiers. Furthermore,
the later lines of code rely on the evaluation of the earlier lines of code
to determine the values associated with the identifers used. More specifically,
the evaluation of the expression in the assignment statement on line 7
(i.e., the expression <code>delta_x*delta_x + delta_y*delta_y</code>)
requires that the values associated with identifiers <code>delta_x</code> and
<code>delta_y</code> be
known; these identifiers are assigned values on lines 5 and 6.
</p>

   <h3>Sequencing</h3>
<p>
   Evaluation of a sequence of statements begins at the first and continues
through the last. In the example above, the assignment statement on line
1 will evaluate before that on line 2, which evaluates before line 3, and
so on. This "flow of control" from the first statement (top) to the last
statement (bottom) is important to the proper evaluation of a sequence of
statements (i.e., evaluation proceeds from top to bottom or from first to
last). This "flow" is illustrated in the trace tables below.
</p>

<p>
Later sections will introduce statements that augment this standard flow
of control, but they are best viewed as modifications of the standard
flow of control.
</p>


   <h2>Trace Tables</h2>
<p>
   Evaluating a sequence of assignment statements is done by evaluating
each assignment statement in turn, from top to bottom. The evaluation of an
assignment statement requires evaluating the expression within to determine
the value
to bind to the specified identifier (to the left of the <code>=</code>
symbol).  Of course, evaluating such an expression will often require using
the known <em>identifier bindings</em> (identifier/variable names and their
associated values) to determine the values of the identifiers used within
the expression.  This can be a lot to track, so our analysis will benefit
from some structure. This section introduces trace tables to structure our
reasoning of the evaluation of statement sequences. At present such
sequences will include only assignment statements, but later chapters will
extend the use of these trace tables to more advanced programs.
</p>


<h3>Beginning</h3>

<p>
We begin tracing with a table that includes one row per line in the program under evaluation. These
rows, from top to bottom, represent the flow of control through the evaluation of the statement
sequence. Each row will be updated to include any bindings established by the statement on the
corresponding line. Prior to evaluating the first line of code, the set of Known Bindings is
empty<sup><a id="footnote-3-home" href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup>.
</p>

<h3>Step One</h3>

<p>
Evaluation of the statement on Line 1 binds the value <code>2</code> to <code>x1</code> which
is reflected in the trace table as an entry for Line 1. As written, this appears as a simple
duplicate of the line of code in the program, but this is only because that line is an assignment
of an integer literal (<code>2</code>) to an identifier. More generally, each binding is an
association between an identifier and a value.
</p>

<p>
   You should complete the table for the evaluation of Lines 2 through 4 before moving on.
</p>

<h3>Steps Two Through Four</h3>

<p>
Lines 2 through 4 are similarly structured assignment statements (wherein the expression is a
literal value), so the introduction of new bindings proceeds in the same manner as for Line 1. The
table below shows those entries.

<h3>Step Five</h3>

<p>
On Line 5, to evaluate the expression <code>x2 - x1</code> we must know the value bound to
<code>x2</code> and the value bound to <code>x1</code>. The Trace Table can be used to determine
these values based on the previously evaluated statements. To find these values, we look to the
trace table for the row that corresponds to the line being evaluated (Line 5, here). We then
search the table in reverse (from this row to the first row), stopping if a binding for the
identifier we seek is found. It is this value that must be used in the expression evaluation.

<p>
For the evaluation of Line 5, when searching for the value of <code>x2</code>, the rows corresponding
to Line 4 and Line 3 are examined. The binding <code>x2 = 10</code> is found, giving 10 as the value
to use for <code>x2</code>. Similarly, when searching for the value of <code>x1</code>, the rows for
Lines 4, 3, 2, and 1 (in this order) are examined. The binding <code>x1 = 2</code> is found, giving 2
as the value to use for the evaluation of <code>x1</code>. With these values determined, the assignment
on Line 5 can be evaluated and the new binding added to the table.

<h3>Steps Six and Seven</h3>

   <h2>Common Misconceptions and Errors</h2>

<p>
When developing programs, one will commonly read and trace code as part of
the debugging process. We must acknowledge that it is common to make mistakes
while programming and should leverage the tools available to aid in the
discovery of these mistakes. Below we trace two code sequences with common
mistakes and one with a common misconception.
</p>

   <h3>Missing Binding</h3>

<p>
In the following example, the trace table has been completed through Lines 1 
and 2. The next step is then to evaluate the expression on Line 3. To do so,
the values bounds to <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> must
be determined by searching the trace table. This search is also illustrated
in the trace table below.
</p>

<div class="trace">
<blockquote class="code">
<ul>
<li><span class="code_gutter">1</span><span class="code_line">a = 2</span></li>
<li><span class="code_gutter">2</span><span class="code_line">b = 4</span></li>
<li><span class="code_gutter">3</span><span class="code_line">result = a * 2 + b * c</span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<table>
<caption>Initial Code</caption>
<thead>
<th>Line</th>
<th>Known Bindings</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td/>
<td/>

<td class="missing">&#10008;</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>a = 2</td>
<td class="found">&checkmark;</td>
<td/>
<td>&#8593;<sup>c?</sup></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>b = 4</td>
<td>&#8593;<sup>a?</sup></td>
<td class="found">&checkmark;</td>
<td>&#8593;<sup>c?</sup></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td></td>
<td>&#8593;<sup>a?</sup></td>
<td>&#8593;<sup>b?</sup></td>
<td>&#8593;<sup>c?</sup></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>
In this example, one can see that the value bound to <code>c</code> is not
found in the trace table. As such, the expression on Line 3
(<code>a * 2 + b * c</code>) cannot be evaluated.
</p>

<p>
An error of this sort is often identified as the use of an undeclared (or
undefined) identifier (i.e., <code>c</code> has not been assigned to).
But this mistake could just as easily be due to mistyping an identifer name
when writing the expression. The Python interpreter cannot determine intent
(though recent versions attempt to identify misspellings with suggestions
in such cases) so the default error reported is that the identifier is
undefined.
</p>

   <h3>Sequential Flow</h3>

<p>The following code is very similar to that in the previous example. In
fact, it fails for the same reason: <code>c</code> is undefined. This is
often surprising because <code>c</code> is assigned to on Line 4. Recall
that a sequence of statements is evaluated from top to bottom. As such,
the expression on Line 3 (<code>a * 2 + b * c</code>) will result in an
error before Line 4 is even to be considered.

   <h3>Changing a Binding</h3>

<p>The example below illustrates a very common misconception that is entirely
reasonable if one views assignment from a different perspective. This example
is used to reinforce the mental model of evaluation that we are building, not
to explore an alternative perspective.
</p>

<div class="trace">
<blockquote class="code">
<ul>
<li><span class="code_gutter">1</span><span class="code_line">a = 2</span></li>
<li><span class="code_gutter">2</span><span class="code_line">b = 10 * a</span></li>
<li><span class="code_gutter">3</span><span class="code_line">a = 3</span></li>

<p>Evaluation of Line 1 and Line 2 proceed as one expects from the previous
examples. Line 1 binds <code>2</code> to <code>a</code> and Line 2 creates
a binding based on this binding for <code>a</code>.
</p>

<div class="trace">
<blockquote class="code">

<li><span class="code_gutter">1</span><span class="code_line">a = 2</span></li>

</div>

<p>Note carefully that <code>b</code> is bound to the <em>value</em> of
the expression <code>10 * a</code> when Line 2 is evaluated. At this
point in the overall evaluation, we can see from the trace table that
<code>a</code> is bound to <code>2</code>. As such, the <em>value</em>
bound to <code>b</code> is <code>20</code> (the result of <code>10 * a</code>
where <code>a</code> is <code>2</code>).
</p>

<p>
Evaluation continues on Line 3 with a reassignment to <code>a</code>. To
be clear, such reassignment is common in some programming styles (though
not terribly useful in this example) but does increase the complexity of
reasoning about code.

<p>If you think that each of these steps is clear, or at least consistent
with the mental model presented in this chapter, then that is wonderful.
</p>
<p>
You may then be wondering what the misconception is.  It is not uncommon
to believe that the value of <code>b</code> remains based on the value of
<code>a</code>, so that when <code>a</code> changes on Line 3, then
the value of <code>b</code> should change. It does not.
</p>

<p>An assignment creates a binding between an identifier and a value
that results from evaluating the assignment's expression immediately.
Changing this binding requires assigning to the same identifier.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
A sequence of statements (assignments in this chapter) is evaluated from
top to bottom in order. We use trace tables to track the introduction (and
modification) of bindings to identifiers as we trace the evaluation of
such statements. Doing so aids in building our mental model of evaluation.

<p id="footnote-1">1. There are cases where one might trace code in a
   more general/abstract manner (such as when developing test cases,
   when debugging, when reading function definition in isolation, or
   when considering user input) but our goal at present is to consider
   self-contained code.

<p id="footnote-2">2. The use of the <code>=</code> symbol for assignment 
   is an unfortunate choice.  Those new to programming often read this as
   a declaration of (or check for) equality, as one might expect from
   mathematics, but this is not the behavior of an assignment statement,
   as will be illustrated.

<p id="footnote-2">3. The Python runtime environment does establish an
   initial set of bindings, but our focus here is on those explicitly
   introduced by the code under evaluation.
